# MDCS 2.0 Installation Process

## INTRODUCTION

* This document describes a step by step installation process for installing MDCS 2.0 using familiar `pip install` processes through the Python Packaging Index (PyPI).

* These instructions support the manual installation process for MDCS software version 2.0 (a.k.a., __mdcs__ located at https://github.com/usnistgov/mdcs .

* More information about the Materials Data Curation System (MDCS) as a configuration of the Configurable Data Curation System (CDCS) of modular applications exists in the form of a [system manual](https://cdcs.nist.gov/cdcs-documentation/index.html), [tutorials](https://cdcs.nist.gov/cdcs-documentation/17-tutorials.html), and more at http://cdcs.nist.gov .

## Notes for Particular Installation Platforms

* The default path of installation steps was written originally for installation on Windows systems.
* However, the steps were organized to be as general as possible with sufficient context information to be installed smoothly and easily on Non-Windows systems.
* The system has been successfully installed by a number of folks now on Non-Windows platforms such as Mac and Linux variants using this procedure with the following considerations kept in mind.
* To apply the given PyPI process to a Linux environment to get a basic installation going, there are only slight modifications to should be performed.
* Specific differences you should be aware of when installing on Linux or Mac are as follows:

  1. **Suppporting Utilities:** The specific supporting utilities that are downloaded (i.e., redis, celery, mongo) - the install links for all those point to generic locations where you should just choose the ones appropriate to your platform.

  2. **Virtual Environment:** The specific python virtual environment may be varied, but it doesn't have to be.
     1. That is, you can install `mkvirtualenv` on Linux or Mac. So, those commands should remain idential.
     2. If you decide to use a different one, just substitute any desired python virtual environment application and the instructions inside of it should remain the same.
     3. If you use an alternative application for creating and using python virtual environments, then merely use the appropriate equivalent commands for each command involving the python virtual environment.
     4. Mostly, the commands used for the python virtual environment have to do with:
       1. creating it (`mkvirtualenv`),
       2. activating it (`workon <mdcs_virtual_environment_name>`),
       3. deactivating it (`deactivate <mdcs_virtual_environment_name>`).
         * NOTE: Corresponding commands for related utilities often use very similar or identical commands.

  3. **Command Shell:** The commands executed in this installation occur in a windows command shell, in the case of Linux or Mac, they would be in the standard scripting shell (which is usually some kind of bash variant).

  4. **Command-Line Syntax:** The command-line syntax for one or two steps may need slight modification in Linux or Mac. For example, on Windows, when one starts the redis-server application, one refers to the executable as "redis-server.exe" and uses a path that goes to the default windows redis configuration file. These parameter-names would probably have a slightly different name (such as 'redis_server' and a different configuration-file-path-name) in the Linux or Mac environments, but other than that, the essential command and intent should be the same in each case.

  5. **Skip Windows-Only Step:** There's a step in the Windows install process that is Windows-specific, toward the end, where a given package (celery) needed to be updated (uninstalled/reinstalled) for a slightly different version because of a well-known Windows-specific bug/dependency in that community-library. That step is labeled as "Windows-only". So, just skip that step when installing for Linux or Mac.

* Other than the above cases, the rest of the process should be able to be executed as is.


### Parameter Values

1. Readers of this document are expected to make appropriate adjustments where their system's parameters differ from those described in this process.
2. Particularly for security-sensitive settings, such as usernames and passwords, readers are strongly encouraged:
	1. **DO** select parameter values which are secure and relevant to their installation.
	2. **DO NOT** use the example default parameter values provided here (which are insecure).
3. The default parameter values and examples used throughout this document are only provided for the purposes of illustrating the installation process steps as concretely as possible.

### Assumptions

* This installation process is being performed on a __Windows platform__.
	* If one is installing the MDCS on an operating system other than Windows, then
	  one must be sure to make the necessary modifications to each command or instruction.
		* e.g., such as using a different command terminal than the Windows platform command-line terminal. Please see the notes above for those installing on Mac or Linux platforms.
	* With only small modifications, this process should also easily work on additional platforms where Python and Django are generally supported.
* The reader who is performing this installation process is familiar with basic tasks in that environment such as:
	* Updating environment variables (e.g., PATH).
	* Opening a command-line terminal (e.g., cmd.exe).
	* Following installation instructions for installing each application.
* The system on which this installation process is being performed has an __Internet connection__.
* Installation steps mostly involve typing or entering various commands at a command-line terminal (e.g., cmd.exe).
	* Some steps will require that additional tasks be performed (such as downloading and extracting files, executing installers, etc.).

### Conventions

* Certain steps described in these procedures should only take place within a __Python virtual environment__ in which the MDCS application is created.
	* Commands that **should** happen in __only virtual-environment__ command-line terminal windows will be prefixed with **'$$'**.
	* All other commands that should NOT occur in a virtual-environment (but which often occur in the __system-level-environment__) command-line terminal window will be prefixed with **'$'**.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

###	1. Install supporting applications on your host system.

* Python 2.7: https://www.continuum.io/downloads (choose python 2)
* MongoDB 3.4.1: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community
* Redis 5.0: https://redis.io/download
* Celery    : NOTE: This is installed below via `pip install`.
* gettext   : This utility is necessary for supporting internationalization in MDCS 2.0 systems >= MDCS 2.0 beta2.
    - On Linux,
      - $$ `apt-get install gettext`
    -On Windows,
		  - https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html

###	2. Configure the execution environment.

* Update the environment variable, __PATH__, to include the installation paths of each of the above-installed applications, respectively.

###	3. Open terminal window #1 and perform the first set of installation commands.

#### Open a terminal window.

```
$ cmd.exe
```

#### Install mkvirtualenv

* NOTE: This enables you to install the MDCS software in Python virtual environments.

* Command:
```
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper
$ mkdir <install_path>\
$ cd <install_path>\
$ mkvirtualenv <mdcs_virtual_environment_name>
```
* Example:
```
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper
$ mkdir c:\mdcs\
$ cd c:\mdcs\
$ mkvirtualenv mdcs_env
```

* NOTE: This __mkvirtualenv__ command:
	* Creates a new __Python virtual environment__: __mdcs_env__.
	* Automatically puts you into the virtual-environment after creating it.

#### Install the latest version of pip installation utility inside the newly-created virtual-environment.

```
$$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Download, extract, and configure mdcs from git repository.

* Download https://github.com/usnistgov/mdcs/archive/master.zip to the <install_path>\ directory.
* Extract mdcs-master.zip to form the following base installation directory: <install_path>\mdcs-master\ .
* Then move into that base install directory.

```
$$ cd mdcs-master
```

#### Create configuration file directory for MongoDB.

```
$$ mkdir conf
```

#### Create data directory for MongoDB.

```
$$ mkdir data\db
```

#### Create <install_path>\mdcs-master\conf\mongodb.conf file with the following content:

* NOTE: This instruction asks the user to:
	1. Create a new file, mongodb.conf, in the <install_path>\mdcs-master\conf\ directory.
	2. Ensure that the given file has the following content.
	3. Save that file as the primary MongoDB configuration file.

* General File Contents:

```
net:
   bindIp: <ip_address>
security:
   authorization: enabled
storage:
   dbPath: <install_path>/mdcs-master/data/db
```

* Example:

```
net:
   bindIp: 127.0.0.1
security:
   authorization: enabled
storage:
   dbPath: c:/mdcs/mdcs-master/data/db
```

$$ pip install -e git://github.com/MongoEngine/django-mongoengine.git@v0.2.1#egg=django-mongoengine
$$ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
$$ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.core.txt
```

#### Start MongoDB server.
```
$$ mongod --config conf\mongodb.conf
```

###	4. Open terminal window #2 and perform the next set of installation commands.

#### Open terminal window.

```
$ cmd.exe
```

#### Open virtual environment and move to the release installation directory.

* Command:
```
$ workon <mdcs_virtual_environment_name>
$$ cd <install_path>\mdcs-master\
```
* Example:
```
$ workon mdcs_env
$$ cd <install_path>\mdcs-master\
```

#### Create MongoDB administrative user.

* Command:

**NOTE:** Enter your own mongodb administrative username and password here. See the example below.

```
$$ mongo --port 27017

	use admin
	db.createUser(
	{
	user: "<mongodb_admin_username>",
	pwd: "<mongodb_admin_password>",
	roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"},"backup","restore"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* Example:

```
$$ mongo --port 27017

	use admin
	db.createUser(
	{
	user: "mdb_admin_user",
	pwd: "mdb_admin_pwd",
	roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"},"backup","restore"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* NOTES:
	* From within MongoDB's shell, type (or copy/paste!) each line, hitting the <ENTER> key after each one.
	* When done entering these commands, the user will be logged out from MongoDB.


#### Create MongoDB non-administrative user.

* Command:

	* Enter your own mongodb usernames and passwords for administrative and non-administrative accounts, respectively, here. Please see the example below.

```
$$ mongo --port 27017 -u "<mongodb_admin_username>" -p "<mongodb_admin_username>" --authenticationDatabase admin
	use mgi
	db.createUser(
	{
	 user: "<mongodb_nonadmin_username>",
	 pwd: "<mongodb_nonadmin_password>",
	 roles: ["readWrite"]
	}
	)
	exit
```


* Example:

```
$$ mongo --port 27017 -u "mdb_admin_user" -p "mdb_admin_pwd" --authenticationDatabase admin
	use mgi
	db.createUser(
	{
	 user: "mdb_user",
	 pwd: "mdb_pwd",
	 roles: ["readWrite"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* NOTES:
	* From within MongoDB's shell, type (or copy/paste!) each line, hitting the <ENTER> key after each one.
	* When done entering these commands, the user will be logged out from MongoDB.

#### Edit and save <install_path>\mdcs-master\mdcs\settings.py file.

* Original settings.py settings:
```
		MONGO_USER     = "mgi_user"
		MONGO_PASSWORD = "mgi_password"
```

* Change to:

	* Command:
		* Enter your own mongodb non-administrative username and password here. See the example below.
			* Edit <install_path>\mdcs-master\mdcs\settings.py
			* Change MONGO_USER and MONGO_PASSWORD settings to your own mongodb non-administrative username and password.

	```
			MONGO_USER     = "<mongodb_nonadmin_username>"
			MONGO_PASSWORD = "<mongodb_nonadmin_password>"
	```

	* Example:

	```
			MONGO_USER     = "mdb_user"
			MONGO_PASSWORD = "mdb_pwd"
	```

#### Start Redis server.

* Command:
```
$$ redis-server <redis_configuration_filename>
```

* Example:
```
$$ redis-server "c:\Program Files\Redis\redis.windows.conf"
```

* NOTES:
	* When redis-server starts, it will create a background process and will return to the command terminal prompt, allowing one to reuse that terminal to run other commands

#### **(ON WINDOWS ONLY)** Remove incompatibility with celery 4.x.

```
$$ pip uninstall celery
$$ pip install celery==3.1.18

```

* NOTES:
	* In some cases, it appears that Celery 4.x is incompatible with Windows. Thus, Windows users are asked to downgrade their Celery to an earlier version in order for it to work on Windows.
	* However, non-Windows users should be able to skip this step and use Celery 4.x as is.

#### Start celery.

```
$$ celery -A mdcs worker -l info -Ofair --purge
```

###	5. Open terminal window #3 and perform the last set of installation commands.

```
$ cd <install_path>\mdcs-master\
$ workon mdcs_env


$$ python manage.py migrate auth
$$ python manage.py migrate
$$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

* Ensure `gettext` utility is installed
    - On Linux,
      - $$ apt-get install gettext
    -On Windows,
	  - install gettext from https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html

$$ python manage.py compilemessages
	  * NOTES:
		- The `compilemessages` process requires the `gettext` utility.
		- If you receive an error message, check previous step was successful.

$$ python manage.py createsuperuser

```
* Command:
	* When prompted, fill in the following info:
		* username      : <mdcs_superuser_username>
		* email         : <mdcs_superuser_email>
		* password (x2) : <mdcs_superuser_password>

* Example:
	* When prompted, fill in the following info:
		* username      : mgi_superuser
		* email         : user_email@institution.com
		* password (x2) : mgi_superuser_pwd

#### Run the system.

* Command:
```
$$ python manage.py runserver <ip_address>:<port_number>
```

* Example:
```
$$ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

###	6. Open system URL in a browser.

* Command:
	* open: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>

* Example:
	* open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

###	7. Login with superuser credentials.

* NOTE: The default from the top is username=mgi, password=mgi.

## Appendix A: Starting up a fully-installed system from a shutdown state

### Ensure MongoDB, Redis, and Celery are running in command-line windows.

#### in terminal window #1

```
$$ mongod --config conf\mongodb.conf
```

#### in terminal window #2

```
$$ redis-server "c:\Program Files\Redis\redis.windows.conf"
```

* NOTES:
	* The above is the syntax for a Window's Redis install. This may be different on other operating systems.
	* When redis-server starts, it will create a background process and will return to the command terminal prompt, allowing one to reuse that terminal to run other commands

```
$$ celery -A mdcs worker -l info -Ofair --purge
```

#### in terminal window #3

#### Run the system.

* Command:
```
$$ python manage.py runserver <ip_address>:<port_number>
```

* Example:
```
$$ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Open browser: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>

* Command:
	* open: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>

* Example:
	* open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Login with superuser credentials.

* Command: login with:
	* username: <mdcs_superuser_username>
	* password: <mdcs_superuser_password>

* Example: login with:
	* username: mgi_superuser
	* password: mgi_superuser_pwd

## Note: Migration from a 3.4.x to 4.0.x mongoDB server

This migration is only for existing and populated database. It allows to perform a migration of of a standalone MongoDB server without losing data.

1. Turn off the mongo daemon and install the 3.6.x binaries.
2. Turn on the 3.6.x version of the newly installed mongo daemon.
3. MongoDB is now running on a 3.6.x server with a 3.4.x data storage. The feature compatibility version need to be setup on the new MongoDB server engine. This modification will perform several operations on the data storage to match with the MongoDB server engine. First, a custom role to grant the permission to the admin user has to be created. Start a connection to the running 3.6.x deamon:
    ```
    mongo --host <mongo_url> --port <port> -u <admin_login> -p <admin_pwd> --authenticationDatabase admin)
    ```

    Create the new role named fcv:

    ```
    use admin
    db.getSiblingDB("admin").createRole({role: "fcvRole",privileges: [{ resource: { db: "$setFeatureCompatibilityVersion", collection: "version"}, actions: ["update"]},{ resource:{cluster: true}, actions: [ "getParameter"]}],roles: []});
    ```

4. Grant the new fcv role to the admin user
    ```
    db.grantRolesToUser('<admin_login>', [{ role: 'fcvRole', db: 'admin' }])
    ```
5. Then set the feature compatibility version to 3.6
    ```
    db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )
    ```
6. Restart the MongoDB server

MongoDB is now running on a 3.6.x server with the correct data storage. The migration from this 3.6.x to the latest MongoDB server version 4.0.x can now be performed.

1. Turn off the mongo daemon and install the 4.0.x binaries
2. Turn on the 4.0.x version of your mongo daemon
3. MongoDB is now running on a 4.0.x server with a 3.6.x data storage. The feature compatibility version to the new MongoDB server engine need to be set. In this new version of MongoDB engine the fcv role we created previously is not enough to execute the  feature compatibility version command, so a new privilege to the admin user need to be granted. Start a connection to the new MongoDB server similar to the previous step (3.) and then grant the clusterAdmin role to the admin user:
    ```
    use admin
    db.grantRolesToUser('<admin_login>', [{ role: 'clusterAdmin', db: 'admin' }])"
    ```
5. Then set the feature compatibility version to 4.0
    ```
    db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )'
    ```
6. Restart to MongoDB server. The migration is completed.
